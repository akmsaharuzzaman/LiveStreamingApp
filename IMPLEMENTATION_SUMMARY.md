## ✅ FIXED: setState Memory Leak Issue

**Problem:** The app was crashing with setState() memory leak errors when navigating between pages, specifically on the home page.

**Root Cause:** Stream subscriptions in `homepage.dart` and `golive_screen.dart` were calling `setState()` after widgets were disposed, causing memory leaks and crashes.

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Added StreamSubscription variables** to properly track subscriptions
2. **Added `mounted` checks** before every `setState()` call 
3. **Implemented proper `dispose()` methods** to cancel subscriptions
4. **Updated both `homepage.dart` and `golive_screen.dart`** with the same fixes

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/homepage.dart`
- ✅ `lib/features/live-streaming/presentation/pages/golive_screen.dart`
- ✅ Created `SETSTATE_FIX_GUIDE.md` documentation

**Testing Status:** ✅ Flutter analyze completed successfully with no critical errors

## ✅ FIXED: App Icon Missing Issue

**Problem:** Android app icon was not showing after build, despite icon files being in correct directories.

**Root Cause:** Missing `android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"` attribute in `AndroidManifest.xml` application tag.

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Updated AndroidManifest.xml** to include proper icon reference
2. **Verified icon files exist** in all mipmap density directories
3. **App builds successfully** with icon properly configured

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- ✅ Created `APP_ICON_SETUP.md` documentation  
- ✅ Created `verify_app_icon.ps1` verification script

**Testing Status:** ✅ App builds successfully, icon should now display properly
